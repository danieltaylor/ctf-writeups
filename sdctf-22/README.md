#### Description

> San Diego CTF, also known as SDCTF, is an annual Capture the Flag competition hosted by undergraduates at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The competition will be jeopardy-style and run in the 48 hour period from May 6 to May 8, 2022. We encourage participation from teams on and off campus, of all ages and backgrounds.
>
> This event is hosted yearly by ACM Cyber, the chief cybersecurity organization on campus at UC San Diego. This yearly competition allows us to train our members, build our internal resources, and give back to the greater cybersecurity community.
>
> There is no team size limit and we use static scoring. Challenges vary across the disciplines of Open Source Intelligence, Cryptography, Web Hacking, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation, Jail Escapes, Forensic Analysis, and others. At the end of a 48 hour period, the teams participating are ranked by number of points, with ties broken by who reached that number of points first.
